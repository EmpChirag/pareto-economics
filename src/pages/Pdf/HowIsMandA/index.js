            <p className="text-xl pb-5">
              This whitepaper is an essential read for the institutional
              investor, cross border business operator and foreign investment
              policy maker who are looking to successfully navigate these
              seemingly unpredictable and growing hostile investing climate.

            <p className="text-xl pb-5">
              When reviewing the literature on cross-border M&A as it relates to
              China, one glaringly obvious trend emerges, that being – most
              whitepapers are written for a non-Chinese audience from the
              non-Chinese perspective. Little if any work covers this
              fascinating topic from the Chinese perspective for a non-Chinese
              audience. This is what this whitepaper attempts to do.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl pb-5">
              A better understanding of the Chinese perspective, plan and
              strategy will better equip the M&A community no matter where they
              are to make more informed, confident and profitable investing
              decisions.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl pb-5">
              This whitepaper covers the most important and at times least
              talked about flashpoints that have defined and continue to shape
              the Chinese M&A strategy and how the global West has responded.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl pb-5">
              We focus on three key bilateral relationships, including;
              US-China, EU-China and UK-China, this whitepaper details the
              unique aspects of these three bilateral relationships, how they
              have developed and what problems the M&A community will most
              likely face in the near future. It ends with the reader having a
              more comprehensive understanding of the state of these
              relationships, especially given the unique timing we are faced
              with today.

              We then conclude with 10 further research questions which we feel
              are the natural next steps for any M&A practitioner to be asking.
              If you so wish to engage us with these or other questions, we
              would be more than happy to lend our thinking and experience to
              you.{" "}

            <p className="text-xl pb-5">
              Much of the literature, forecasts, opinions and strategy regarding
              China and M&A comes from a western perspective for a western
              audience. Not much added value can be offered in that regard given
              the sheer volume of work that has facilitated that position thus
              far. What is less available and also much less understood or
              misunderstood, is the Chinese perspective on the changing
              investment and geopolitical landscape, their opinions on the West
              and how they plan to engage with western and other global players
              in this brave new world. This is the blind spot which this
              whitepaper will attempt to fill.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl pb-5">
              To begin with, it is important to realise that there seems to have
              developed an asymmetric understanding between the West and China
              that needs rebalancing. This investor parallax has afflicted the
              non-Chinese investor and business operator which has resulted in
              missteps, underestimations of China’s ambitions and growth and an
              overestimation of the West’s ability to absorb China into its way
              of doing things.

                The policy of engagement with China began in 1972 with President
                Nixon & Henry Kissinger and has continued on through eight
                different presidential administrations. Most notably perhaps in
                1979 when the then Chinese Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping visited
                Texas under the leadership of the Carter administration. This
                was a memorable public display of Sino-US friendship which hoped
                to usher in a new age of normalisation based on a common belief
                and acceptance of open markets, transparency, and cooperation.

              The macro strategy of the US was to reward relationship
              normalisation with opening US markets to Chinese investment and
              expecting the same, thus showing how much better off they would
              both be with this new free market status quo, this was then hoped
              to lead to a transition of the political order from Communism to
              Democracy on the part of China, which would naturally lead to a
              changing of the political guard as democracy would dictate,
              therefore ensuring a dramatically reduced military threat from
              what would have been a belligerent power. It didn’t turn out that

              The US strategy post WWII was to open up their manufacturing
              markets to the world, this allowed Japan to pursue an export-led
              growth model. Nations like South-Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore
              followed suit. This high export-led growth in South East Asia was
              to become known as the Asian Tigers. US businesses which produced
              low value goods like luggage for example were allowed to go out of
              business and were replaced by imports, thus allowing a focus on
              high value tech and financial services.

              This was the same trajectory they expected the Chinese to take,
              but they did not. China’s 1.433 billion market was and continues
              to be such an attractive pull for US industry that policymakers
              have given up earlier attempts to transform the nation
              politically, focusing mainly on accommodating the political
              situation whilst simultaneously taking advantage of its
              manufacturing base. Consecutive US presidents have undermined the
              personality, and historical make-up of the Chinese, they have
              learnt the long and hard way that China is not as malleable and
              prone to outsider influence especially when it comes to how it
              runs its political affairs. Having spent 4,000 tumultuous years
              consolidating its landmass, the only way China continues to be as
              powerful as it is, is by having a centralised political system
              that it can control. Socialism with Chinese characteristics as
              former Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping put it shows China’s ability to
              be malleable and pragmatic…but on its own terms.

            <p className="text-xl pb-5">
              In response to increasing external economic shocks, China’s 14th
              Five-Year Plan, formulated at the 19th Party Congress in October,
              attaches great importance to the pursuit of self-reliance and
              technological sovereignty. The new ‘dual circulation’ (经济双循环)
              development model, will be the overarching policy during the 14th
              five-year plan period. As uncertainty rises in the international
              environment, this model is set to prioritise the development of
              China’s internal economy – to increase domestic consumption and
              upgrade the domestic industrial chain. This is not to suggest that
              China is abandoning its long-term policy of ‘reform and opening
              up’, as China has reaffirmed their commitment to international
              trade, cooperation and economic governance. However, it does
              indicate stronger nationalist sentiments among economic
              policymakers.

              In an October 2020 speech, Xi Jinping announced that China must
              pursue independent innovation, make breakthroughs in key core
              technologies, strive to achieve independent control in key fields,
              ensure the security of the industrial chain and supply chain, and
              enhance China's science and technology ability to respond to

              China is likely to strengthen industrial policies aimed at
              financial, operational, and regulatory support for companies in
              key sectors. This is strongly aligned with its "Made in China
              2025" (中国制造2025) initiative, first unveiled in 2015, which
              outlines China’s plans for supply-side structural reform and a
              move away from low value-added manufacturing. China has vowed to
              develop a favourable policy environment for domestic firms in
              sectors of strategic importance, offering tax incentives,
              subsidies, and an accelerated administrative process.

              foreign firms operating in Chinese markets. Equally, such
              preferential treatment is likely to heighten accusations of

              China’s Outbound Foreign Investment
            </h3>
            <p className="text-xl pb-5">
              In 2020, the volume of China’s M&A transactions has declined for
              the fifth consecutive year. This has been due to several factors
              including heavier debt loads, tighter domestic liquidity
              conditions, Beijing’s controls on outbound capital flow and an
              increase in trade and investment restrictions abroad. This
              downward trend is only set to continue as geopolitical tensions
              rise and supervision in destination markets is tightening.

              However, in the context of China's latest economic "dual cycle"
              strategy, “external circulation" needs to serve domestic economic
              growth, and overseas investment and cross-border mergers and
              acquisitions will be no exception. The acquisition of
              international brands and advanced technology can bring additional
              investment, consumption and employment opportunities to the
              country, and is likely to receive strong support from the Chinese

              it will steadily expand the QDLP pilot area, with plans to add

            <p className="text-xl pb-5">
              Ever since President Nixon & Henry Kissinger landed in Beijing
              marking the beginning of the US’s policy of engagement in 1972
              US-China relations have changed considerably. However, one
              constant theme has characterised the US-China relationship ever
              since and that is the consistent hands-on approach by the US to
              actively form and shape the relationship, or rather shape what
              they wanted the Chinese to do in the relationship.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl pb-5">
              Given its position as the world’s only superpower back then and
              still one now, this “proactive” approach was to be expected. The
              intention at the start was to form a bilateral relationship with
              the Chinese before the Russians did in order to disrupt what could
              have been a dangerous alignment of two strong powers.
            </p>

                  One constant theme has characterised the US-China relationship

            <p className="text-xl pb-5">
              They were successful in this, but over the years and decades the
              US has become increasingly disillusioned with what they perceived
              as China’s broken promises and increasingly antagonistic,
              secretive and belligerent behaviour in the fields of business,
              diplomacy, trade, research and technology.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl pb-5">
              However, from the Chinese perspective, it is clear to Beijing what
              benefits the US would enjoy if China were to behave in the way the
              US and the wider West wants, specifically in respect to trade,
              opening up its economy and allowing a transition to democratic
              elections. What is unclear to the Chinese is how the US sees these
              changes benefiting China, or more specifically the CCP.

              Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernisation Act (FIRRMA)
            </h3>
            <p className="text-xl pb-5">
              As it concerns M&A, when looking at the last four years under the
              Trump administration, many key decisions have been made which have
              impacted the inward follow of Chinese investment. The first of
              which includes the passing of the Foreign Investment Risk Review
              Modernisation Act (FIRRMA) in 2018. This bill was created as an
              extension of the legal protections regarding the national security
              of America in relation to trade and investment.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl pb-5">
              Coming from a long linage of legislative protections as it
              concerns national security, dating back to the Tariff Act of 1789,
              which was enacted as a response to Alexander Hamilton’s thinking
              regarding “infant industries”. This act was largely military and
              strategic in nature<sup>1</sup>.

              At the turn of the century, the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917
              was used to nationalise assets during World War I and to block all
              foreign investment during World War II<sup>2</sup>.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl pb-5">
              FIRRMA was born out of the nexus of increased fear regarding
              China’s growing strategic and economic clout and the potential
              loss of American technology supremacy, with urgency ignited by the
              attempted Broadcom-Qualcomm merger. The resulting legislation
              attracted significant industry attention, especially from venture
              capital
              <sup>3</sup>.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl pb-5">
              With the enactment of FIRRMA the US is more clearly defining who
              its friends and foes are. FIRRMA grants the President the
              authority to block or suspend proposed or pending foreign
              “mergers, acquisitions, or takeovers” by or with any foreign
              person that could result in foreign control of any United States
              business, including such a merger, acquisition, or takeover
              carried out through a joint venture that threaten to impair
              national security4. The seven largest investing countries are all
              United States allies. They include; the United Kingdom, Japan,
              Germany, France, Canada, Switzerland, and the Netherlands –
              combined they account for 72.1 percent of U.S. affiliate value
              added. In response, FIRRMA limits reviews on investments from
              companies in allied countries, or “excepted foreign states”
              including Australia, Canada and the UK in regards to
              non-controlling transactions. Furthermore, it gives these nations
              two years to develop similar legislation in order to continue the
              daisy chain of nation security protectionism.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl pb-5">
              In regards to Chinese inbound investment, FIRRMA is especially
              invasive. The act underlines that every two years the Secretary of
              Commerce shall submit to congress and to CFIUS a report on ALL
              transactions made by entities of the People’s Republic of China,
              including information on: The Ultimate Beneficial Owner, Dollar
              amount invested, Type of investment: Greenfield/Brownfield,
              Sector, and an analysis of patterns in the investment and how they
              align with the Made in China 2025 strategy. Naturally the Chinese
              are unhappy about this and highlight the fact that the United
              States is restricting the opportunity for China to share in the
              same benefits afforded to the Asian Tigers by the US after the
              cold war, under the auspices of national security. In response,
              the Chinese National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and
              the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) in December 2020 jointly
              released the new rules for reviewing foreign investment on
              security grounds. These are scheduled to come into force in
              January 2021. The 23-clause new rules rest upon the Foreign
              Investment Law and the National Security Law as a legal basis.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl pb-5">
              This has seen mixed reactions from the M&A community. Naturally,
              for Chinese firms this will slow down and limit business growth
              especially as it relates to acquisitions in industries related to
              national security. Given also the fact that there has been a
              creeping definition of what national security actually means, with
              industries like health and pharmaceuticals being watched even more
              closely. Given the spread of the coronavirus, national security no
              longer means warfare, but has developed a more sophisticated
              definition and practical application which covers health.

              For the US or excepted foreign states companies this presents an
              opportunity to continue and even increase M&A activity knowing
              that competition for Chinese firms is restricted who might have
              had an edge given the amount of state subsidy support they would
              receive, especially for State Owned Enterprises (SOE). With
              commodities experiencing a deflated price, this allows for rapid
              consolidation in this industry as many smaller and medium players

              Securing reliable and cheap energy is key for China, they have an
              incentive to control the energy and commodity supply chain for
              growing internal consumption, however seeing as energy is a
              national security concern for the US, any attempt to take
              advantage of struggling US energy companies is curtailed with this

              Reverse Mergers and Delisting Chinese Companies from US Exchanges
            </h3>
            <p className="text-xl pb-5">
              A reverse merger is a process in which a private company overtakes
              a public shell company and controls it. This method allows
              companies to avoid the costs and scrutiny inherent to an initial
              public offering, and allows them to more easily become listed in
              U.S. markets5. Although reverse mergers are not inherently
              nefarious investing processes, but the way they have been used by
              Chinese companies has led to action from the US Security and
              Exchange Commission in the form of instituting a stricter set of
              listing rules and even delisting Chinese companies from US
              Exchanges. Since 2009 an estimated 300 Chinese firms have reverse
              merged or reverse IPO’d with American companies. Many Chinese
              firms which have performed a reverse merger in the US and Canada
              have been found perusing fraudulent activity and keeping western
              investors in the dark.

              A few examples uncovered by research firm Muddy Waters6 include;
              Sino-Forrest which is a forestry company located in Hong Kong. S-F
              listed on the Toronto Venture Exchange in Canada nearly over 20
              years ago via reverse merger. It was eventually delisted by the
              Ontario Securities Commission when evidence surfaced of endemic
              fraud by the company including overstating assets to the tune of
              $900m, the creation of phoney third parties, and fraudulent
              purchase orders.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl pb-5">
              China Media Express holding (Fig.2) was also another example of a
              reverse merger gone wrong. CME is an advertising company that
              plays television ads in buses throughout the Republic of China. In
              2009, they began trading on the Nasdaq via a reverse merger when
              they took over the shell company TM Entertainment & Media. CME
              were found to be involved in several illegal practices including;
              management pump and dump schemes, false claims of business
              penetration claiming to advertise on 27,200 buses when in fact
              only 12,565 carried them, inflation of revenue figures by over
              $78m, claiming falsely to be associated with Apple. After several
              other negative news stories its auditors Deloitte Touche Tohmantsu
              (Deloitte affiliate) resigned. On the same day (11<sup>th</sup>{" "}
              March), CME shares were halted after a 48% decline caused by the
              Muddy Waters report. In May of the same year, they were delisted
              from the Nasdaq.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl pb-5">
              Many more examples of these practices are still coming out which
              has prompted action by the Trump administration. On 4th June 2020,
              A memorandum on Protecting United States Investors from
              Significant Risks from Chinese Companies was issued by President
              Trump, tasking the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets
              (PWG) with examining certain risk to investors in U.S. financial
              markets posed by the Chinese government’s failure to allow audit
              firms that are registered with the Public Company Accounting
              Oversight Board (PCAOB) to comply with U.S. securities laws and
              investor protection requirements7. The PWG recommended several
              measures that would protect investors including; enhancing listing
              standards to require, as a condition to initial and continued
              exchange listing in the United States, PCAOB access to work papers
              of the principal audit firm for the audit of a listed company.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl pb-5">
              For companies that are unable to satisfy that standard as a result
              of governmental restrictions on access to audit work papers and
              practices in Non-Compliant Jurisdictions (NCJ), this standard may
              be satisfied by providing a co-audit from an audit firm with
              comparable resources and experience where the PCAOB determines if
              it has sufficient access to audit work papers and practices to
              conduct an appropriate inspection of the audit firm.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl pb-5">
              To reduce market disruption, the recommended new listing standards
              would provide for a transition period until 1st January, 2022 for
              currently listed companies from NCJs to come into compliance. The
              PWG also recommends enhanced issuer disclosures, enhanced fund
              disclosures, greater due diligence of indexes and index providers,
              and the issuance of guidance with respect to fiduciary obligations
              for investment advisors considering investment in NCJs<sup>8</sup>

            <p className="text-xl mb-5">
              Before Biden officially took office, he committed to maintaining
              Trump’s hard-line stance on China; although, it is widely expected
              that he will target China through multilateral action rather than
              using executive authority. However, recent signalling by the new
              Biden administration has showed he will be taking a more
              conciliatory tone with China, this move would please the Chinese
              administration but has worried the US defence and security
              establishment.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl mb-5">
              Biden has made it clear he will preserve protectionist measures on
              strategic, high-tech sectors such as aerospace, quantum
              communications, and AI. But it is unlikely Biden will follow Trump
              into arbitrary disputes over non-critical tech e.g., TikTok,
              WeChat.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl mb-5">
              As expected, President Biden has enacted a series of executive
              orders on his first day in office which clearly define his
              position on a range of issues, including; revoking permits for the
              keystone XL pipeline which struck a sour note with Canada, a
              reversal on travel bans targeting primarily Muslim countries and
              stopping construction of the border wall. However, his focus on
              other key policy issues such as; China, 5G security, illegal
              immigration, Iran, Nicaragua and Venezuela seem to have been
              demoted as compared with the Trump administration which held
              hawkish positions on those area.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl mb-5">
              Furthermore, his stance and strategy on a belligerent Russia and
              collaborative outreach for allies like the UK and EU on matters
              including post BREXIT trade, a unified response to terrorism and

              This team have had previous experience with President Biden in his
              role as former Vice President, or with the Democratic Party in
              general and they are likely to support Biden’s efforts to reengage
              with allies and resume multilateral cooperation. What is notable
              that bar a small handful of appointees, none have deep experience
              engaging with China which may present a problem especially as
              Biden develops his macro-outlook and engagement strategy with

              traditional and professional style, without the volatility of the
              prior Trump administration. Given China’s unbroken political
              leadership it is unlikely that they will deviate much or not at
              all from their current dual circulation development model. This is
              because this model was developed in part due to the increasingly
              combative stance of the United States and formed with an
              underlining understanding that this would be the best road for
              China even if former President Trump won a second term. He didn’t,
              so it may be the case that this model will be easier to implement
              especially if Biden adopts a more conciliatory tone with China.

            <p className="text-xl mb-5">
              Sino-EU relations presents a more complex picture because unlike
              the US the EU is a political and economic bloc made of 27 member
              nations all with their own perspectives, incentives, agendas and
              visions, so when it comes to pan EU alignment on new, and at times
              contentious issues like Chinese FDI it becomes difficult to speak
              with one voice. The majority of Chinese FDI is in the form of
              acquisitions. Some major acquisitions of European firms include;
              Volvo cars, and Kuka, a German maker of industrial robots.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl mb-5">
              In regards to its Dual Circulation Development Model, part of
              China’s aim is to transcend the “middle income trap” and the best
              strategy to achieve this aim is via growth through acquisition.
              Given the maturity and experience of EU companies in industries
              like manufacturing, technology, logistics, robotics and others,
              China is taking advantage of their ability to provide state
              subsidies for M&A activity such as financing via government
              supported investment funds e.g., Sino-CEEF Fund, cheaper
              financing, loan guarantees, tax rebates etc.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl mb-5">
              Two problems arise when considering Sino-EU M&A, the first is in
              relation to EU rules laying out the limits and controls of state
              subsidies. These are very clear when it comes to intra-EU M&A,
              however the rules and regulations are more blurred and less
              comprehensive when it comes to non-EU inbound M&A. This allows an
              unfair advantage for non-EU countries to use disproportionate
              state subsidy support to bolster successful acquisition targets
              for State Owned Enterprises (SOE).
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl mb-5">
              There is limited information on the actual number of foreign
              subsidies being granted. This is mainly due to a lack of
              transparency and low compliance9 with the obligation to notify
              subsidies under the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing
              Measures (SCM Agreement10).

              Xi Jinping emphasised that China is committed to building a new
              development pattern, which will provide Europe and the world with
              more market opportunities and create greater space for
              cooperation. It is hoped by the Chinese that the EU will adhere to
              free trade and multilateralism and provide Chinese investors with
              an open, fair and non-discriminatory business environment.

              Chinese media claims the successful negotiations of CAI are
              undoubtedly a major victory for China. The China-EU investment
              agreement came at an interesting time. It in fact was agreed three
              weeks before the Biden Administration took office, safe in the
              knowledge that a Trump administration could not fire back at what
              is sees as a bad deal for the collective stance of democracy and
              human rights of the West. Furthermore, with the UK having
              “Brexited,” the EU needs to plug the gapping budgetary whole that
              the UK left which stands at £11 billion (US$15 billion) in 2018.
              Knowing the problems, the EU faces in terms of non-EU state
              subsidies, this deal at least allows much greater access to
              Chinese markets.

              <p className="text-xl mb-5">
                The UK starts off 2021 having completed and agreed what was
                probably the most important political and economic agreement in
                a generation, that being BREXIT. It now sails into unchartered
                territory with a climate of economic uncertainty, an
                ever-consuming pandemic, shifting geopolitical sands and a
                leadership determined to prove that they are able to navigate
                the storms. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has a lot on his plate.
                He must now decide what role the UK plays in international
                affairs, this will be predicated on his vision, abilities and
                resources at his disposal.
              </p>
              <p className="text-xl mb-5">
                As it relates to China, the UK has an ability to speak with a
                more defined and independent voice following BREXIT, with Prime
                Minister Johnson signalling to business his intentions which at
                times seem to be giving off mixed signals as it relates to
                China. The results of BREXIT have been similar for both sides
                for similar reasons. As we explored for the EU, they seek growth
                opportunities and new markets, the UK on the other hand is also
                looking towards China seeking a boost to UK exports, although
                officially no such ambition is expressed.
              </p>
              <p className="text-xl mb-5">
                What can be observed for certain is the fractious nature of the
                cabinet in regards to the UK’s stance on China. This was
                apparent during last year’s major U-turn on Chinese 5G provider
                Huawei. Pressure was building the for government to U-turn on
                their proposals to use Huawei technologies for Briton’s 5G
                infrastructure, its fate was sealed after Washington imposed
                sanctions claiming the firm poses a national security threat -
                something Huawei denies. Furthermore, the UK instructed UK
                mobile providers to remove all the Chinese firm's 5G kit from
                their networks by 2027.
              </p>
              <p className="text-xl mb-5">
                January also saw an interesting developed in parliament when
                Lord Alton proposed a “genocide amendment” to a Trade Bill going
                through parliament. This would have allowed future trade deals
                with nations like China to be assessed on the basis that a
                corresponding nation does not violate human rights of its own
                people.
              </p>
              <p className="text-xl mb-5">
                The amendment was proposed as an attempt to break the present
                gridlock which exists with international courts. Often these
                courts are unable to make rulings on genocide because nation
                states such as China do not recognise the relevant courts, or
                veto any reference to such matters.
              </p>
              <p className="text-xl mb-5">
                This proposal would have allowed the UK high court be able to
                make legal judgements on genocide a preliminary determination,
                that the government would then have to consider. There was major
                cross-party support of this amendment including from former
                foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt and Conservative MP Ian Duncan
                Smith. On January Tuesday 19th this amendment was defeated by
                319 to 308.

                The UK has always been a good place for business which is why
                there has been such interest from foreign companies to stake
                their claim to the UK consumer, and furthermore to have a base
                in the UK from which to operate a regional office. The UK leads
                in tech innovation, healthcare, R&D and media and continues to
                attract the attention of the M&A activity. However, as the UK
                government recognises, we are also seeing long-term shifts in
                the balance of global economic and military power, increasing
                competition between states, and the emergence of more powerful
                non-state actors<sup>13</sup>.
              </p>
              <p className="text-xl pb-5">
                In response, the UK has moved to introduce new legislation which
                attempts to protect national security, whilst at the same time
                keeping the UK open and attractive for business investment to
                the rest of the world. This balancing act comes in the form of
                the new National Security & Investment Bill (NSIB). Resembling
                the US Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernisation Act and
                other similar measures taken by other allies including Canada
                and Australia, the NSIB will give government new powers to
                screen investments on the ground of national security. Some
                examples of “qualifying assets” which will aim to be protected
                include: trade secrets, databases, source code, algorithms,
                formulae, designs, plans, drawings and specifications, software
                <sup>14</sup>.

                Although not mentioning China explicitly the UK government does
                recognise that the UK, and UK businesses, face continued and
                broad-ranging hostile activity from those who seek to compromise
                their national security and that of their allies. Such behaviour
                left unchecked can leave the UK vulnerable to disruption, unfair
                leverage, and espionage. It is crucial that the government is
                able to fully combat these threats coming from ever more
                determined overseas actors<sup>15</sup>.

                With China’s dual circulatory model focusing on increasing
                domestic consumption and upgrading its domestic industrial
                chain, these measures may, as a second order effect, impact
                China’s ability to do this. This is especially true when
                external expertise and innovation in areas with dual use
                capabilities are required to reach these aims.
