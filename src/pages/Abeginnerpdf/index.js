              This White Paper is based on research and analysis undertaken by
              Pareto Economics and FINTRAIL

            <p className="text-xl pb-5">
              Geopolitics is a phenomenon that is increasingly impacting the
              global fintech and financial services ecosystem. This is giving
              rise to a series of interconnected risks that are both new and
              difficult to mitigate, especially with the existing risk
              management frameworks.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl pb-5">
              The core conclusions from this whitepaper are threefold:
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl pb-5">
              <span className="font-bold"> fintecy,</span> professionals
              especially in the risk management and business growth strategy
              space are lacking a robust and UpToDate understanding of
              geopolitics and globalised power and how they impact risk.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl pb-5">
              <span className="font-bold">Secondly,</span> those in leadership
              positions such as MLROs, CXO’s, Management and Analysts need to
              have a more active and hands-on approach when assessing
              undiscovered and future risk to the business. A check box approach
              to risk management is not enough.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl pb-5">
              <span className="font-bold">Thirdly,</span> given the changing
              nature of world affairs, fintechs are experiencing a growing need
              to hire for geopolitical awareness and analysis skills and/or to
              seek outside assistance in order to properly hedge against an
              increasingly complex risk landscape. Most at risk departments
              include compliance, business strategy and operations.

              <span className="font-bold">The first section,</span> “From Bone
              to Bitcoin” documents the evolution of fintech over its
              20,000-year history from primitive forms of accounting to the
              digital assets of today giving much-needed context to the
              importance and development of financial technology.

              Section two,
              <span className="font-bold"> “Defining Geopolitics”</span>
              explains in a simple and useful way what geopolitical risk is and
              how it differs from political risk.

            <p className="text-xl pb-5">
              Section three,
              <span className="font-bold">“Centres of Power (CoP)”</span>
              introduces the reader to the concept of globalised power as well
              as the developmental differential and why the Centres of Power
              theory is a much better explainer of power structure and
              influence, using the US as an example of this theory in action.

              Section four,
              <span className="font-bold">“The Great Convergence”</span>
              describes in a clear way how and why geopolitics becomes a

              distinguishes how geopolitical risk is not a one size fits all
              consideration. Its effect on fintech is dependent on the nature of
              the risk as well as the characteristics of the fintech itself.

              fintech and with the help of two interesting case studies shows
              how geopolitics can impact the fintech market in very unexpected
              ways.

              looks at three key geopolitical events involving tax evasion,
              terrorist financing, and money laundering that had a direct impact
              on anti-financial crime practice. Firstly, we’ll review the
              circumstances and events around these three crime types that led
              to the realisation of new risks, and legislative changes to
              counter those risks.

              addresses how fintech can inform and protect themselves from
              future risk by adopting integrated approaches between risk
              management and geopolitical analysis to help make the fintech
              ecosystem a hostile environment for those looking to exploit it.

            in 20,000 BCE, to representative money during the Mesopotamian era
            in 3000 BCE, to the use of standardised coinage in the form of small

            The modern fintech stands on the shoulders of more than 20,000 years
            of innovation and development, and like fintechs of the past, they
            have got their fair share of risks to manage, mitigate and hedge.

            Financial innovation has grown as a result of technological

          <p className="text-xl pb-5">
            For some fintech professionals, the main and perhaps only result of
            active geopolitical risk is the rising use of sanctions. Although
            sanctions implementations are an important result of geopolitics,
            they are not the only repercussion of rising geopolitical risk that
            fintechs need to be aware of. Other risks like money laundering, tax
            evasion and terrorist financing are also primary considerations.{" "}

            The rest of this whitepaper will dive into what geopolitical risk is
            and why it seems to be so rampant in all parts of the world. We will
            then discover what risks fintechs face in this brave new world and
            how some have a reflexive relationship with geopolitics. Finally, we
            will discuss what fintech can do better when it comes to mitigating
            geopolitical risk.

              The first place to start when understanding geopolitics is in the
              definition. Geopolitical risk is different to political risk,
              although a lot of the time many analysis and commentators
              mistakenly use both terms interchangeably. Political risk defines
              the risks and dynamics within the borders of a nation, whereas
              geopolitical risk describes the dynamics between nations. This
              distinction is evident in the insurance industry which
              specifically offers Political Risk Insurance (PRI) to companies
              operating in politically volatile regions. This kind of cover
              captures most, but not all, noncommercial risks which result from
              political events, including the direct and indirect actions of{" "}
